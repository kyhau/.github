This repository contains templates and metadata files of [starter workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/creating-starter-workflows-for-your-organization).

ℹ️ Starter workflows created by users can only be used to create workflows in public repositories.

ℹ️ To avoid duplication among starter workflows you can call reusable workflows from within a workflow. This can help make your workflows easier to maintain.
